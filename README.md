# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a small machine learning project developed using Jupyter Notebook. The project involves:

## Key Features

1. **Dataset**
   - The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning and preparation steps were performed to ensure the dataset is suitable for analysis and model training.

3. **Machine Learning**
   - Various machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated.

4. **Data Analysis**
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset.

## Usage

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt` (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn)

### Steps to Run:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tharinduakash/ML_Projec
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess data, analyze the dataset, and build machine learning models.

## Results

- Key findings and model performance metrics are included in the notebook.

## Acknowledgments
